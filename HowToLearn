For now, I will use rstudio server hosted on Google Compute Engine.
I will learn deep learninig by reading and trying examples on [R interface to Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/index.html).
Also I find [this blog](http://colah.github.io) post very helpful for understanding and I would like to read almost all the material there.
